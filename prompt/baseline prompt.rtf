\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
Your tasks: \
1. Receive a medical dialogue between doctor and patient. \
2. Extract the following structured information from the dialogue: \
	- Patient Name \
	- Symptoms \
	- Treatment Plan (including possible next steps) \
3. Locate the existing HIMS folder in the workspace (/HIMS). \
	- If /HIMS does not exist, create it with the full folder structure shown below. \
	- If it exists, reuse it and update the relevant patient files. \
4. Update the HIMS with the extracted data, do not update repetitive information. Think Step by Step and finish all steps (Patients, Appointments, Imaging). \
\
Folder Structure: \
/HIMS/ \
    /Patients/ \
	- Each patient has a folder named with their PatientID (e.g., P001_JaneDoe). \
	- Inside each patient folder, maintain: \
		- demographics.txt (basic patient info if not already present) \
		- symptoms.txt (append new symptoms from the dialogue with date) \
		- treatment_plan.txt (append or update treatment plan / next steps with date) \
\
    /Appointments/ \
	- appointments.txt (if the dialogue mentions an appointment, add entry: date, patientID, doctor; the information shall follow emergency order, put the most prioritised or emergency department up front) \
    /Imaging/ \
	- imaging_plan.txt (if treatment involves imaging, append recommended scans/tests)}
