HEALTHCARE DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION TASK\
\
**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This system is for educational/simulation purposes only. All patient data must be de-identified. This does not replace professional medical documentation systems or provide medical advice.\
\
**OBJECTIVE**: Process clinical encounter documentation and maintain structured Electronic Health Records (EHR) in a simulated Hospital Information Management System (HIMS).\
\
**INPUT REQUIREMENTS**:\
- Clinical encounter transcript (doctor-patient dialogue)\
- Must contain de-identified or fictional patient information only\
\
**CORE TASKS**:\
\
1. **CLINICAL DATA EXTRACTION**\
   Extract and validate the following structured elements from the encounter:\
   - Patient Identifier (use de-identified format: P###_InitialsOnly)\
   - Chief Complaint(s)\
   - Reported Symptoms (including onset, duration, severity)\
   - Physical Examination Findings (if documented)\
   - Assessment/Diagnosis (preliminary or confirmed)\
   - Treatment Plan with specific components:\
     * Medications (drug name, dosage, frequency, duration)\
     * Diagnostic tests ordered\
     * Referrals\
     * Follow-up instructions\
   - Provider Information (if available)\
   - Encounter Date/Time\
\
2. **DATA QUALITY VERIFICATION**\
   Before processing:\
   - Confirm all PHI is properly de-identified\
   - Validate medical terminology using standard nomenclature\
   - Flag any ambiguous or incomplete clinical information\
   - Apply ICD-10/CPT coding where applicable (optional enhancement)\
\
3. **HIMS FILE SYSTEM MANAGEMENT**\
   \
   Primary Directory: `/HIMS/`\
   \
   Required Structure:\
   ```\
   /HIMS/\
   \uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  /Patients/\
   \uc0\u9474    \u9492 \u9472 \u9472  /P###_Initials/  (Individual patient folders)\
   \uc0\u9474        \u9500 \u9472 \u9472  demographics.json\
   \uc0\u9474        \u9500 \u9472 \u9472  clinical_notes/\

   \uc0\u9474    \u9500 \u9472 \u9472  laboratory/\
   \uc0\u9474    \u9474    \u9492 \u9472 \u9472  lab_orders_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt\

   \uc0\u9474        \u9492 \u9472 \u9472  rx_orders_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt\
   \uc0\u9492 \u9472 \u9472  /System/\
       \uc0\u9492 \u9472 \u9472  processing_log.txt\
   ```\
\
4. **DATA STORAGE PROTOCOL**\
   \
   For each encounter:\
   \
   a) **Patient Record Updates**:\
      - Create new patient folder if first encounter\
      - Append timestamped entries to existing records\
      - Maintain chronological order in all logs\
      - Include encounter metadata (date, time, provider)\
   \
   b) **Clinical Documentation**:\
      - Store complete encounter notes in `clinical_notes/`\
      - Update `symptoms_log.txt` with new symptoms (include severity scale 1-10)\
      - Create new treatment plan file with version control\
      - Link related orders to patient record\
   \
   c) **Order Management**:\
      - File diagnostic orders in appropriate `/Orders/` subdirectory\
      - Include order priority (STAT/Urgent/Routine)\
      - Add expected turnaround time if specified\
\
5. **OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**\
   \
   Generate structured report containing:\
   - Confirmation of data extraction completeness\
   - File system updates performed\
   - Data validation warnings (if any)\
   - Summary in HL7 FHIR-compatible format (optional)\
   - Audit trail entry\
\
**COMPLIANCE NOTES**:\
- Maintain HIPAA-compliant practices for any real data\
- Use encryption markers for sensitive fields\
- Include access logging for audit purposes\
- Apply retention policies per regulatory requirements\
\
**ERROR HANDLING**:\
- If critical information missing: Flag and request clarification\
- If file system error: Document in system log and attempt recovery\
- If duplicate patient detected: Merge records with conflict resolution\
```\
\
## Key Improvements and Rationale:\
\
### 1. **Clinical Accuracy and Terminology**\
- Added proper medical documentation structure (Chief Complaint, Assessment/Diagnosis)\
- Included severity scales and temporal factors for symptoms\
- Referenced standard medical coding systems (ICD-10, CPT)\
- Structured medication documentation with complete prescribing information\
\
### 2. **Enhanced Data Structure**\
- Implemented JSON format for structured data (better than plain text for demographics)\
- Created separate directories for different order types (lab, imaging, medications)\
- Added versioning for treatment plans\
- Included clinical_notes folder for complete encounter documentation\
\
### 3. **Compliance and Safety Features**\
- Added prominent disclaimer about educational use\
- Emphasized de-identification requirements throughout\
- Included audit logging capabilities\
- Added HIPAA compliance reminders\
- Structured for potential HL7 FHIR compatibility\
\
### 4. **Workflow Optimization**\
- Clear separation between data extraction, validation, and storage phases\
- Added data quality verification step before processing\
- Included error handling protocols\
- Created more granular folder structure reflecting actual clinical workflows\
\
### 5. **Professional Medical Standards**\
- Used proper medical record terminology (encounter, chief complaint, assessment)\
- Included provider information tracking\
- Added order priority levels (STAT/Urgent/Routine)\
- Structured for interoperability with actual EHR systems\
\
## Healthcare Domain Considerations:\
\
1. **Patient Safety**: The optimized prompt emphasizes this is for simulation only and includes disclaimers about not replacing professional medical systems.\
\
2. **Data Privacy**: Multiple references to de-identification and PHI protection ensure users understand privacy requirements.\
\
3. **Clinical Completeness**: The structure captures all essential elements of a medical encounter, ensuring no critical information is missed.\
\
4. **Regulatory Alignment**: The format aligns with common healthcare IT standards and can be adapted for various regulatory environments.\
\
5. **Scalability**: The JSON-based structure and organized file system can handle growing patient populations and complex medical histories.\
\
6. **Auditability**: Built-in logging and audit trails meet healthcare compliance requirements for tracking all system actions.\
\
This optimized prompt transforms a basic file management task into a clinically-relevant, compliance-aware system that mirrors real healthcare IT workflows while maintaining appropriate boundaries for an AI simulation.}
