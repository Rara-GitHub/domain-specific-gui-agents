Typical Presentation\
Patient: "My wife noticed this growth on the back of my head. Sometimes it bleeds when I\
brush my hair, so she insisted I get it checked."\
Doctor: "I'm glad you've come in. Let's go through some questions to understand more\
about this growth."\
Comprehensive History Taking\
1.
\f1  
\f0 Duration and evolution: Doctor: "How long have you had this growth on your\
head?" Patient: "I'm not sure exactly. My wife noticed it a few months ago, but it\
could have been there longer." Doctor: "Have you noticed any changes in its size or\
appearance since you first became aware of it?" Patient: "It seems to be slowly getting\
bigger, I think."\
2.
\f1  
\f0 Symptoms: Doctor: "You mentioned it bleeds sometimes. How often does this\
happen?" Patient: "Maybe once or twice a week when I'm brushing my hair." Doctor:\
"Is there any pain or discomfort associated with it?" Patient: "No pain really, just the\
occasional bleeding."\
3.
\f1  
\f0 Risk factors: Doctor: "Have you spent a lot of time in the sun over the years?\
Perhaps for work or leisure?" Patient: "Actually, yes. I worked in Dubai for about 10\
years. I was often outdoors in the sun."\
4.
\f1  
\f0 Previous treatments: Doctor: "Have you ever had any treatments for skin growths\
before?" Patient: "Now that you mention it, I had something frozen off my forehead\
last year. The doctor called it a... what was it... basal cell something?"\
Physical Examination\
Doctor: "I'd like to examine the growth now if that's alright."\
Patient: "Of course, go ahead."\
Doctor: "Thank you. What I can see is a raised, pearly growth on the back of your head. It\
has a slightly shiny appearance and there's a small area that looks like it might bleed easily."\
Diagnosis Delivery\
Doctor: "Based on what you've told me and my examination, I believe this growth is what\
we call a basal cell carcinoma."\

\cf2 Patient: "Carcinoma? Does that mean it's cancer?"\
Doctor: "Yes, basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. However, I want to reassure you\
that it's a very treatable form of skin cancer. It grows slowly and very rarely spreads to other\
parts of the body."\
Patient: "Oh, I see. Is it because of my time in Dubai?"\
Doctor: "Sun exposure is indeed a major risk factor for this type of skin cancer, so your\
time working outdoors in Dubai likely contributed to its development."\
Management Plan\
Doctor: "I'm going to refer you to a dermatologist for treatment. Given the location of the\
growth, this will be a routine referral rather than an urgent one."\
Patient: "What will the treatment involve?"\
Doctor: "The dermatologist will likely recommend either surgical removal of the growth or\
freezing therapy, similar to what you had on your forehead. They'll do a biopsy to confirm\
the diagnosis and then proceed with treatment."\
Patient: "Will I need to take time off work?"\
Doctor: "The procedure is usually done as an outpatient, so you shouldn't need much time\
off. However, you might want to take a day or two to recover, especially if they opt for\
surgical removal."}
