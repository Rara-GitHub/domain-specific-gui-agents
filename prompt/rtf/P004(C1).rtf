\f2\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0  \'93Good morning, could you please tell me your child\'92s name?\'94\

\f2\b Parent:
\f1\b0  \'93Yes, this is Daniel Carter, he\'92s 7 years old.\'94\

\f2\b Doctor:
\f1\b0  \'93Hello Daniel. What brings you both in today?\'94\

\f2\b Parent:
\f1\b0  \'93He\'92s been wheezing and coughing, especially at night, for the past week. We\'92ve been using his inhaler more often than usual.\'94\

\f2\b Doctor:
\f1\b0  \'93Any fever, chest pain, or trouble breathing during the day?\'94\

\f2\b Parent:
\f1\b0  \'93No fever, but he did complain of chest tightness during football practice yesterday.\'94\

\f2\b Doctor:
\f1\b0  \'93Understood. Does Daniel have any allergies?\'94\

\f2\b Parent:
\f1\b0  \'93Yes, he\'92s allergic to dust mites.\'94\

\f2\b Doctor:
\f1\b0  \'93Thank you. I\'92ll examine him now. His oxygen levels are a little low, and I can hear wheezing on both sides.\'94\

\f2\b Doctor:
\f1\b0  \'93Treatment plan: start a short course of oral prednisolone for 5 days, continue salbutamol inhaler every 4 hours as needed. We\'92ll also arrange peak flow monitoring.\'94\

\f2\b Doctor:
\f1\b0  \'93I\'92d also like a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia, and we\'92ll schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks.\'94}
