\f0\b \cf2 Approach
\f1\b0 \

Doctor: "I see. Can you tell me more about how you discovered this lump?"\
Patient: [Provides details]\
Doctor: "I understand this must be concerning for you. Do you have any family history of breast cancer?"\

[Continue with detailed history taking using MES approach]\
Doctor: "I'd like to examine your breast now. Is that okay with you?"\

\

\f0\b Management
\f1\b0 \
Doctor: "Based on the examination and your family history, I think it's important we refer you to a breast clinic for further assessment. They will likely perform a mammogram, ultrasound, and possibly a biopsy. If a cancer is confirmed, treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Do you have any questions about this?\'94}
