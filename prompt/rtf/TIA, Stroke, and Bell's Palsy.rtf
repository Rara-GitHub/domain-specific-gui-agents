\f0\b\fs24 \cf2 Overview
\f1\b0 \
This guide covers four important scenarios that can cause confusion due to similar presenting symptoms:\
	1. TIA in GP setting\
	2. TIA in A&E setting\
	3. Stroke (telephone call scenario)\
	4. Bell's palsy\
It's crucial to identify and treat each correctly, as management differs significantly.\
\

\f0\b I. Initial Approach
\f1\b0 \
When a patient presents with neurological symptoms:\
Doctor: "Hello, how may I help you today?"\
Patient: "Doctor, I developed some symptoms."\
Doctor: "I see. What sort of symptoms did you experience?"\
Patient: "I developed some weakness, and my face was going to one side."\
\

\f0\b II. Key Diagnostic Question
\f1\b0 \
The critical question to differentiate between TIA/Stroke and ongoing symptoms:\
Doctor: "Do you have any symptoms at the moment as we talk?"\

\f0\b Scenario 1: No Current Symptoms (Potential TIA)
\f1\b0 \
Patient: "No, I don't have any symptoms right now."\
Doctor: "I see. When did you develop these symptoms?"\
Patient: "I developed them last night."\
Doctor: "How long did the symptoms last?"\

\f2\fs25\fsmilli12960 Patient: "They lasted for about 20 minutes."\

\f3\b Scenario 2: Ongoing Symptoms (Potential Stroke)
\f2\b0 \
Patient: "Yes, doctor. I still have some numbness and weakness."\
Note: Any symptoms lasting more than 24 hours are also considered a stroke.\
\

\f3\b III. FAST-3 Assessment
\f2\b0 \
Use the FAST-3 approach to assess symptoms:\

\f3\b T - Time (3 questions)
\f2\b0 \
	1.
\f1  
\f2 Do you have any symptoms at the moment as we talk?\
	2.
\f1  
\f2 When did you develop these symptoms?\
	3.
\f1  
\f2 How long did the symptoms last? (or "How long have you had these symptoms?" if ongoing)\

\f3\b F - Face
\f2\b0 \
Doctor: "Have you had any symptoms on your face? Such as weakness, drooping on one\
side, or numbness?"\
Patient: [Provides answer]\
Doctor: "Any problem with your vision? Have you had any loss of vision? How is your\
vision? Any blurry vision?"\
Patient: [Provides answer]\

\f3\b A - Arm (and other limbs)
\f2\b0 \
Doctor: "Have you experienced any arm weakness, numbness, or difficulty moving your\
arm? What about your leg? Any numbness, weakness, or difficulty moving? Have you had\
any falls or problems with walking? Any limping?"\
Patient: [Provides answer]\

\f3\b S - Speech and Swallowing
\f2\b0 \
Doctor: "Have you had any problems with your speech? Any difficulties with swallowing?"\
Patient: [Provides answer]\

\f3\b \
IV. Differential Diagnosis
\f2\b0 \
Consider other conditions that may present with similar symptoms:\

\f3\b Bell's Palsy
\f2\b0 \

\fs20\fsmilli10080 	\'95
\f1  
\f2\fs25\fsmilli12960 Only affects facial muscles\
Doctor: "Are your symptoms limited to just one side of your face?"\
Patient: [Provides answer]\
Doctor: "Have you noticed any rash along with these symptoms?" (to rule out Ramsay Hunt syndrome)\
Patient: [Provides answer]\

\f3\b \cf2 Guillain-Barr\'e9 Syndrome
\f2\b0 \
Doctor: "Have you had any recent infections, such as diarrhoea or a respiratory infection?"\
Patient: [Provides answer]\
Doctor: "Did your symptoms start from your legs and move upwards?"\
Patient: [Provides answer]
\f3\b \
Myasthenia Gravis
\f2\b0 \
Doctor: "Do your symptoms occur at a certain time of day, particularly in the evenings?\
Have they happened multiple times?"\
Patient: [Provides answer]\
Doctor: "Have you ever experienced any drooping of your eyelids or 'lazy eye'?"\
Patient: [Provides answer]\

\f3\b Brain Tumor
\f2\b0 \
Doctor: "Have you experienced any persistent, focal neurological symptoms?"\

\f3\b \cf2 VI. Examination
\f2\b0 \
For TIA diagnosis in a scenario, the examination should be normal:\
Doctor: "I'm going to perform a brief examination now."\
[Perform examination]\
Doctor: "Your examination appears normal at the moment."\
For Bell's palsy, there will be findings related to the facial nerve:\
Doctor: "I've noticed some weakness in the muscles on one side of your face, which is\
consistent with involvement of the facial nerve."\
\

\f3\b VII. Diagnosis and Management
\f2\b0 \

\f3\b For TIA:
\f2\b0 \
Doctor: "Based on your symptoms that have now resolved and the normal examination, I suspect you may have experienced a Transient Ischemic Attack, or TIA. This is sometimes called a 'mini-stroke'. We need to take this seriously as it can be a warning sign for a future stroke."\
Management:\
	1.
\f1  
\f2 Immediate aspirin (if not contraindicated)\
	2.
\f1  
\f2 Urgent referral to a TIA clinic (usually seen within 24 hours)\
	3.
\f1  
\f2 Address modifiable risk factors\

\f3\b For Stroke:
\f2\b0 \
If symptoms are ongoing or lasted more than 24 hours:\
Doctor: "Your ongoing symptoms suggest you may be experiencing a stroke. This requires\
immediate emergency treatment."\
Management:\
	1.
\f1  
\f2 Call for emergency ambulance\
	2.
\f1  
\f2 Do not give aspirin until a CT scan has been performed\
	3.
\f1  
\f2 Prepare for urgent hospital admission\

\f3\b For Bell's Palsy:
\f2\b0 \
Doctor: "The weakness on one side of your face, without other neurological symptoms,\
suggests a condition called Bell's palsy. This is caused by inflammation of the facial nerve."\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf2 Management:\
	1.
\f1  
\f2 Consider oral steroids if within 72 hours of symptom onset\
	2.
\f1  
\f2 Eye protection advice\
	3.
\f1  
\f2 Possible antiviral treatment if Ramsay Hunt syndrome is suspected\

\f3\b \cf2 VIII. Important Notes and Things to Avoid
\f2\b0 \
1.
\f1  
\f2 Always ask about current symptoms to differentiate between TIA and stroke.\
2.
\f1  
\f2 For chest pain, use a similar approach to differentiate between MI, unstable angina,\
and stable angina:\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f4\fs20\fsmilli10080 \cf2 	o
\f1  
\f2\fs25\fsmilli12960 Ask: "Do you have chest pain at the moment as we talk?"\

\f4\fs20\fsmilli10080 	o
\f1  
\f2\fs25\fsmilli12960 If yes: Consider MI\

\f4\fs20\fsmilli10080 	o
\f1  
\f2\fs25\fsmilli12960 If no: Ask about the circumstances when pain occurred\

\f5\fs20\fsmilli10080 		\'a7
\f1  
\f2\fs25\fsmilli12960 If at rest: Consider unstable angina\

\f5\fs20\fsmilli10080 		\'a7
\f1  
\f2\fs25\fsmilli12960 If only during exertion: Consider stable angina\
3.
\f1  
\f2 Don't forget to assess all aspects of FAST-3, including vision problems.\
4.
\f1  
\f2 Consider other neurological conditions in your differential diagnosis.\
5.
\f1  
\f2 Focus on both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors in your assessment.\
6.
\f1  
\f2 Remember the DATES mnemonic for lifestyle factors: Diet, Alcohol, Tobacco, Exercise, Stress.\
7.
\f1  
\f2 For TIA, give aspirin immediately if not contraindicated.\
8.
\f1  
\f2 For suspected stroke, do not give aspirin until a CT scan has been performed.\
9.
\f1  
\f2 Be prepared to arrange urgent referrals or emergency services as needed.\
10.
\f1  
\f2 Provide clear explanations to patients about their condition and the reasons for your management plan.\
11.
\f1  
\f2 Always consider the impact of the patient's occupation, especially for conditions that may affect their ability to work safely (e.g., driving occupations).\
12.
\f1  
\f2 Don't rely solely on classic textbook descriptions. Be prepared for variations in presentation and atypical cases.\
13.
\f1  
\f2 Remember that the urgency of referral for TIA depends on the patient's occupation, especially if it involves driving.\
14.
\f1  
\f2 For urgent referrals, don't specify an exact timeframe to the patient unless asked. If asked, you can say it usually takes about 4-6 weeks.\
15.
\f1  
\f2 Be aware that a 2-week urgent referral is typically reserved for suspected cancer pathways.\
16.
\f1  
\f2 When explaining CPAP for sleep apnea, mention that it might be uncomfortable at first but patients usually adapt over time.\
17.
\f1  
\f2 Always mention the increased risk of heart-related conditions like heart attacks or strokes if conditions like sleep apnea or TIA are left untreated.\
18.
\f1  
\f2 Avoid dismissing symptoms even if they seem minor. Take all reports seriously, especially when accompanied by other concerning symptoms.\
19.
\f1  
\f2 If a spouse or family member is mentioned as noticing symptoms, involve them in the discussion if present, or suggest they accompany the patient to future appointments.\
20.
\f1  
\f2 Be thorough in your history taking. Don't forget to ask about recent weight changes, alcohol consumption, smoking, and any previous surgeries or injuries that might be relevant.\
21.
\f1  
\f2 When discussing lifestyle changes, be specific and realistic. Offer concrete suggestions for improvement rather than general advice.\
22.
\f1  
\f2 Remember to arrange follow-up appointments to discuss test results and monitor progress, even for conditions that may seem less urgent.\
