\f0\b\fs38 \cf2 Setting:
\f1\b0 \cf2  GP Clinic\

\f0\b \cf2 Patient:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Mr. Ahmed, 78 years old, brought in by his daughter.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Hello, I\'92m Dr. Patel, one of the doctors here. Could you confirm your father\'92s full name and age, please?\

\f0\b \cf2 Daughter:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Yes, this is Ahmed Khan, he\'92s 78.\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Thank you. Mr. Ahmed, I can see you seem a bit tired today. Could you tell me what\'92s been happening?\

\f0\b \cf2 Daughter:
\f1\b0 \cf2  He\'92s been quite confused the last two days and also coughing a lot.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  I see. Has he had a fever or chills?\

\f0\b \cf2 Daughter:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Yes, yesterday evening he was shivering.\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  And has he had any chest pain or difficulty breathing?\

\f0\b \cf2 Daughter:
\f1\b0 \cf2  He\'92s been breathing faster than usual.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Thank you. From what you describe, I\'92m concerned about a 
\f0\b \cf2 chest infection, possibly pneumonia
\f1\b0 \cf2 , which can sometimes cause confusion in older people.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Daughter:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Oh, is that serious?\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  It can be, especially in someone his age. The safest option is to admit him to hospital today for tests\'97such as a chest X-ray and blood work\'97and to start antibiotics promptly.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Daughter:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Will he need to stay long?\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  That depends on his response to treatment, but we\'92ll review daily. In the meantime, please bring along his medication list and any allergies.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Safety Netting:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \
If he becomes more short of breath, unresponsive, or develops blue lips before reaching hospital, please call 
\f0\b \cf2 999 immediately
\f1\b0 \cf2 .}
