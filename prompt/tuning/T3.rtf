\f0\b\fs38 \cf2 Setting:
\f1\b0 \cf2  GP Clinic\

\f0\b \cf2 Patient:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Sarah, 25 years old.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Hello, I\'92m Dr. White, one of the GPs. Could you confirm your name and age, please?\

\f0\b \cf2 Patient:
\f1\b0 \cf2  I\'92m Sarah Johnson, 25.\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Nice to meet you, Sarah. What brings you in today?\

\f0\b \cf2 Patient:
\f1\b0 \cf2  I\'92ve been getting these sudden \'93flutters\'94 in my chest. It\'92s worrying me.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  I understand that can be frightening. When do you usually notice them?\

\f0\b \cf2 Patient:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Mostly when I\'92m resting at night. They last a few seconds.\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Any chest pain, fainting, or family history of heart problems?\

\f0\b \cf2 Patient:
\f1\b0 \cf2  No, none.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Thank you. From what you describe, these sound like 
\f0\b \cf2 benign ectopic beats
\f1\b0 \cf2 \'97extra heartbeats that are common in young people and usually harmless. They often come and go with stress, caffeine, or lack of sleep.\
\

\f0\b \cf2 Patient:
\f1\b0 \cf2  So I don\'92t need treatment?\

\f0\b \cf2 Doctor:
\f1\b0 \cf2  Not necessarily. We can do an 
\f0\b \cf2 ECG
\f1\b0 \cf2  today to check your heart rhythm. If that\'92s normal, no medication is needed. The main advice is: reduce caffeine, manage stress, and get regular sleep.}
