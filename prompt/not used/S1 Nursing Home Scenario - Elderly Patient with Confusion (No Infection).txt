Approach to Communication
		
1. Telephone Call to Nursing Home
Doctor: "Hello, is this Sunnyside Nursing Home?" 
Staff: "Yes, it is."
Doctor: "Hello, I'm Dr. Smith calling from City Hospital. I'm calling about one of your residents who was brought in today due to confusion. May I know your name and role?" 
Staff: "I'm Jane, one of the carers. I've been looking after this lady regularly."
Doctor: "Thank you, Jane. Can you confirm the patient's name and details for me?" 
Jane: "Yes, it's Mrs. Elizabeth Johnson, born on 15th May 1943."
Doctor: "Thank you. Now, can you tell me more about the confusion you've noticed in Mrs. Johnson?" 
Jane: "She's been acting strangely, not like her usual self. She seems disoriented and is having trouble recognizing some of the staff." 

2. History Taking
Doctor: "What specific things have you noticed about her behaviour?" Jane: "She's been
forgetting where her room is, mixing up staff members' names, and yesterday she tried to
leave the home saying she needed to pick up her children from school."
Doctor: "I see. When did you first notice these changes? Has it been getting better or
worse?" Jane: "We first noticed about three days ago. It seemed to come on suddenly and
has been getting gradually worse."
Doctor: "How is Mrs. Johnson's memory usually? Has she been diagnosed with dementia?"
Jane: "No, she's usually quite sharp. She's never been diagnosed with dementia. She usually
manages her own medications and remembers all her grandchildren's birthdays."
Doctor: "Has she had any recent infections? Any fever, cough, or urinary symptoms?" Jane:
"No, she hasn't shown any signs of infection. Her temperature has been normal and she
hasn't complained of any pain or discomfort."
Doctor: "Has Mrs. Johnson had any falls recently?" Jane: "Yes, now that you mention it, she
fell three days ago when getting up from a chair."
Doctor: "Can you tell me more about this fall? What happened just before, during, and
after?" Jane: "She was sitting in the lounge and tried to stand up quickly when her daughter
arrived. She lost her balance and fell backwards. She didn't hit her head on anything, but
she did land quite heavily on her bottom."
Doctor: "After the fall, did she have any immediate confusion, vomiting, memory
problems, balance issues, or weakness in any part of her body?" Jane: "No, she seemed fine
immediately after. She was a bit shaken up, but she was talking normally and walked back
to her room without any problems. But over the next few days, she slowly started becoming
confused."
Doctor: "Has she had any headaches, nausea, or visual disturbances since the fall?" Jane:
"She did mention a headache yesterday, but we didn't think much of it at the time. She
hasn't complained of nausea or any vision problems."
Doctor: "What medications is Mrs. Johnson currently taking?" Jane: "She's on amlodipine
for high blood pressure and simvastatin for cholesterol. She also takes a daily
multivitamin."
Doctor: "Does she have any allergies?" Jane: "Yes, she's allergic to penicillin."
Doctor: "Who are her next of kin? Does she have any advance directives or DNR orders?"
Jane: "Her daughter, Sarah, is her next of kin. I don't believe there are any advance
directives or DNR orders, but I'd have to check her file to be certain."

Management Plan
Based on the history and presentation, the likely diagnosis is a chronic subdural
hematoma.
Doctor: "Thank you for all this information, Jane. Based on what you've told me, especially
about the fall a few days ago, we suspect that Mrs. Johnson may have developed a slow
bleed in her brain. This is called a chronic subdural hematoma. We're going to do a CT
scan to confirm this. If confirmed, she may need a small surgery to remove the blood clot."
Jane: "Oh, I see. Is it our fault this happened?"
Doctor: "It's difficult to say whether this is related to her care. Falls can happen despite best
precautions, especially in older adults. What's important now is to focus on her treatment.
I can assure you that before we discharge her, we'll refer her to social services for a safety
assessment to help prevent future falls."
Jane: "Thank you, doctor. What should we do now?"
Doctor: "For now, please send over any additional medical records you have for Mrs.
Johnson. We'll keep you updated on her condition and treatment plan. If her family contacts you, please let them know we're taking care of her and that they can call the
hospital for more information."
Jane: "Of course, I'll do that right away."
Doctor: "Thank you, Jane. If you think of any other information that might be relevant,
please don't hesitate to call back."
