Management
Doctor: "Based on the examination and your family history, I think it's important we refer you to a breast clinic for further assessment. They will likely perform a mammogram, ultrasound, and possibly a biopsy. If a cancer is confirmed, treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Do you have any questions about this?”
