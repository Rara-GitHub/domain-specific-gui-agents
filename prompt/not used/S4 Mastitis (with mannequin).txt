Approach
[Similar initial questions to Scenario 6]
Doctor: "Have you noticed any fever or chills?"
Patient: "Yes, I've been running a fever for the past day or so."
Doctor: "Have you noticed any redness or a warm area on your breast?"
Patient: "Yes, there's a red, sore area on my [left/right] breast."
Examination
Doctor: "I need to examine your breast now. Is that alright?"
Patient: "Yes, go ahead."

[Perform examination on mannequin]
Doctor: "Thank you. I can feel a tender, firm area in your breast, which is consistent with mastitis."
Management
Doctor: "Based on your symptoms and the examination, you have a condition called mastitis. This is an infection in the breast tissue. Here's how we'll treat it:
	1. I'll prescribe an antibiotic called flucloxacillin. It's safe to take while breastfeeding. Take it for the full course, even if you start feeling better.
	2. For pain relief, you can take paracetamol. Avoid aspirin as it's not recommended while breastfeeding.
	3. Continue to empty the breast by feeding or expressing milk. This is important for your recovery.
	4. Use warm compresses before feeding and cold compresses after to help with discomfort.
	5. Rest as much as possible and stay well-hydrated.
	6. If possible, start feeds on the affected breast to ensure it's emptied effectively.
If your symptoms don't improve after a couple of days on the antibiotics, or if they get worse, please come back to see us immediately."
