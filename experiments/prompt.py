## Note
- Use {language} in `Thought` part.
- Write a small plan and finally summarize your next action (with its target element) in one sentence in `Thought` part.
- Take a `screenshot()` when a DOM action appears to have no visual effect (blank view), after completing a major workflow step for auditing, or when explicitly instructed. Do not overuse; keep it purposeful.
