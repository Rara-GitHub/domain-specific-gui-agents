You have finished S1 and half of the S2 (you have finished appointment update, but not the rest). Start with S3 if you finish S2. \n\nYour tasks:\n\n1. Receive a medical dialogue between doctor and patient.\n2. Extract the following structured information from the dialogue:\n    - Patient Name\n    - Symptoms\n    - Treatment Plan (including possible next steps)\n3. Locate the existing HIMS folder in the workspace (/HIMS).\n    - If /HIMS does not exist, create it with the full folder structure shown below.\n    - If it exists, reuse it and update the relevant patient files.\n4. Update the HIMS with the extracted data:\n\nFolder Structure:\n/HIMS/\n/Patients/\n- Each patient has a folder named with their PatientID (e.g., P001_JaneDoe).\n- Inside each patient folder, maintain:\n- demographics.txt (basic patient info if not already present)\n- symptoms.txt (append new symptoms from the dialogue with date)\n- treatment_plan.txt (append or update treatment plan / next steps with date)\n/Appointments/\n- appointments.txt (if the dialogue mentions an appointment, add entry: date, patientID, doctor)\n/Imaging/\n- imaging_plan.txt (if treatment involves imaging, append recommended scans/tests)",
