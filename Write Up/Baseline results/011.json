  "instruction": "Continue on simulating a Hospital Information Management System (HIMS) inside your local workspace. \n\nYour tasks:\n\n1. Receive a medical dialogue between doctor and patient.\n2. Extract the following structured information from the dialogue:\n    - Patient Name\n    - Symptoms\n    - Treatment Plan (including possible next steps)\n3. Locate the existing HIMS folder in the workspace (/HIMS).\n    - If /HIMS does not exist, create it with the full folder structure shown below.\n    - If it exists, reuse it and update the relevant patient files.\n4. Update the HIMS with the extracted data:\n\nFolder Structure:\n/HIMS/\n/Patients/\n- Each patient has a folder named with their PatientID (e.g., P001_JaneDoe).\n- Inside each patient folder, maintain:\n- demographics.txt (basic patient info if not already present)\n- symptoms.txt (append new symptoms from the dialogue with date)\n- treatment_plan.txt (append or update treatment plan / next steps with date)\n/Appointments/\n- appointments.txt (if the dialogue mentions an appointment, add entry: date, patientID, doctor)\n/Imaging/\n- imaging_plan.txt (if treatment involves imaging, append recommended scans/tests)\n\n\nElderly Man with Chest Pain (Outpatient Cardiology)\n\nDoctor: “Good afternoon, sir. May I confirm your details?”\nPatient: “Yes, I’m George Williams, born 10th November 1950.”\nDoctor: “What brings you here today?”\nPatient: “I’ve had chest pain on and off for the past month, usually when walking uphill. It goes away when I rest.”\nDoctor: “Does it radiate anywhere?”\nPatient: “Yes, sometimes to my left arm.”\nDoctor: “Any shortness of breath, palpitations, or dizziness?”\nPatient: “Short of breath sometimes, no palpitations or dizziness.”\nDoctor: “Any past medical history?”\nPatient: “High blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. I take ramipril and metformin.”\nDoctor: “Do you smoke?”\nPatient: “I quit 10 years ago, but smoked for 30 years before that.”\nDoctor: “Thank you. On examination, blood pressure is high and ECG shows some ST changes.”\nDoctor: “Treatment plan: start aspirin 75 mg daily and a statin. Increase blood pressure control. Order echocardiogram, fasting lipid profile, and schedule a treadmill stress test. If findings are concerning, we’ll arrange coronary angiography.”\nDoctor: “Follow-up in cardiology clinic in 4 weeks.”",
